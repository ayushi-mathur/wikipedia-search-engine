The '''Pushmataha Area Council''' is part of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].  It renders service to Scout units in ten counties of North [[Mississippi]], providing skills training and character development to boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 18. The council also serves boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 21 through [[Venturing]] Crews and Explorer posts.

In 2007, 24 [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] ranks were earned in the Pushmataha Area Council, and 20 Scouts earned the God and Country Award.

==History==
[[Image:StatueOfLibertyColumbus2.jpg|thumb|upright|Columbus, Mississippi]]
The Pushmataha Area Council was established by the Boy Scouts of America in June, 1925.  The council was originally named the East Mississippi Council, but this name was changed in 1929 to honor Chief [[Pushmataha]] of the [[Choctaw]] tribe.

Chief Pushmataha once told a group of chiefs that he was not born, but instead stepped, full grown and dressed for battle, from the split in a tree that had been struck by lightning. This story has been incorporated into the Pushmataha Area Council Shoulder Patch shown above.  The patch shows a full-grown Pushmataha emerging from a tree struck by lightning. Camp Seminole has a sign on its grounds noting the tree from which Pushmataha supposedly appeared.

In 1925, the headquarters of the council was in [[West Point, Mississippi]], on Main Street.  In 1960s, the council office was moved to its current location at 420 31st Avenue North, [[Columbus, Mississippi]].

The Pushmataha Area Council is one of the smallest Boy Scout councils in America. It is not unusual for other councils to have districts larger than the entire Pushmataha Area Council.

In 1950, the council erected a miniature [[Statue of Liberty]] in the middle of downtown Columbus, Mississippi, as part of a national effort in the Boy Scouts to erect 200 of these statues.  Fewer than 100 of these statues still exist, and even fewer exist intact.  The Pushmataha Area Council statue is one of the few intact ones that exist today.

When fully staffed with professionals, the Pushmataha Area Council has a Scout Executive, two District Executives, and a full-time Camp Ranger. One District Executive resigned in 2007, and the Executive Board of the council did not hire a replacement for the position. The Camp Ranger resigned in the spring of 2009, and the camp is currently (2010) served by a part-time, volunteer, interim Camp Ranger.  The second District Executive resigned in the early fall of 2009, and the council Executive Board did not hire anyone fill that position. The Scout Executive announced in November, 2009 that he was resigning, and as of April, 2010, the Scout Executive position is still vacant.  The BSA Regional Director is acting as the official Scout Executive for the council until one is hired.  The Regional Director is in another state, and is not present to oversee day-to-day operations of the council.  The council is being operated by a small corps of volunteers, and the 2010 FOS campaigns are being run by volunteers with no professional guidance or assistance.

The Council President, George Purnell, has been in office for six years.  All previous council presidents (1925–2004) served a maximum of three years.

==Districts==
When the council began, each town with a Scout troop was its own District.  For example, troops in [[Columbus, Mississippi]] were in the Columbus District.  Later the council evolved into having three districts, the Running Bear District, the Talking Warrior District, and the Tombigbee District.  In 1990s, these three districts were reorganized to create two new districts, the Choctaw District and the Chickasaw District.

The Choctaw District covers five counties: Clay, Lowndes, Oktibbeha, Webster, and Noxubee.

The Chickasaw District also covers five counties: Monroe, Winston, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Calhoun.

==Events==
The Pushmataha Area Council hosts numerous events each year.  These include:

* Eagle Recognition Banquet (early spring)
* Council Pinewood Derby (spring)
* Summer Camp (June)
* Cub Scout Day Camp (June)
* [[Webelos]] Resident Camp (June)
* [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] Leader Specific Training (September&amp;nbsp;— March)
* [[Boy Scout]] Leader Training (late fall)
* [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] Training (bi-annually)
* MSU Scout Football Day (fall)
* MSU Scout Baseball Day (spring)
* [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] Family Weekend (semi-annually)
* Tiger Leader Training (fall)

==Funding==
The Pushmataha Area Council is funded by donations made by civic organizations, businesses, and individuals.  Several different [[United Way of America|United Way]] groups contribute to the council, and most United way funding has remained strong.  United way of Oktibbeha County is an exception, as they have cut their funding to the council by over half in recent years. The Pushmataha Area Council is a 501(c) non-profit organization.

==Service==
Through the [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]], [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]], and [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] programs, the Pushmataha Area Council serves youth ages 6 through 21.  The council offers [[Learning for Life]], a character education program used by local schools.  Explorer posts in the council offer vocation-oriented experience to teenage boys and girls in the council's ten county area.

The original council camp was Camp Pine Springs, in Monroe County, located along the Buttahatchie River north of Columbus, Mississippi. Camp Palila, located in [[Louisville, Mississippi]], became the council camp in 1953.  Camp Palila served as the council camp for thirty years prior to 1980. The state of Mississippi had leased the land to the council, but the legislature failed to complete the new lease before the original lease ended. The land used for Camp Palila reverted to control of the state, and is now Legion State Park.

The current council camp for the Pushmataha Area Council is Camp Seminole, about five miles north of [[Starkville, Mississippi]].  Camp Seminole hosts, among other activities, council [[summer camps]], [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] campouts, leadership training sessions, [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] courses, and [[Order of the Arrow]] events.  Camp Seminole was named for Seminole Manufacturing of Columbus, Mississippi, which donated significant financial support toward the camp's construction.

===History===
Camp Seminole was built on {{convert|285|acre|km2}} of land purchased by the Pushmataha Area Council in 1982.  The need for building the camp came about when the lease on the previous council camp (Camp Palila) expired, and the Mississippi legislature did not renew the lease.

A Brownsea-22 training course was held on the grounds of the new camp in 1982, before any structures or other improvements had been made. Several council camporees were conducted on the grounds before Camp Seminole was fully operational.

In June 1986, Camp Seminole was declared officially &quot;open&quot; when the Pushmataha Area Council [[summer camp]] was held there for the first time.

===Facilities===
Camp Seminole has a dining hall that seats 200 people, a {{convert|12|acre|m2|sing=on}} lake, nine camp sites, a [[C.O.P.E.]] Lodge, an activity field, a shooting sports arena, an [[obstacle course]], numerous open shelters, an environmental center, the [[Chakchiuma]] Nature Trail, a trading post, and the Nita Chito Scout Museum.

Roads on the camp are mainly of red clay gravel construction.

===Activities===
Camp Seminole is primarily a [[Boy Scout]] camp, and is used for camporees, summer camps, Scout leader training, [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] campouts, and other Boy scout related events.

The camp is also used to house [[Habitat for Humanity]] volunteers, for land navigation training by local [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] and [[R.O.T.C.]] units, for Mississippi Hunter Safety Education Training, for [[Red Cross]] [[CPR]] and [[First Aid]] Training sessions, and other community and civic events.

===Topography===
The grounds of Camp Seminole average {{convert|230|ft|m}} above sea level.

===Climate===
The climate at Camp Seminole is considered temperate. Winter temperatures rarely drop below freezing, and summer temperatures reach their peak in July and August, when it can reach 95-100 degrees Fahrenheit (35-38 degrees Celsius).  The rainy season is early December through late March.  Rainfall averages 62&quot; annually.

The [[Order of the Arrow]] is represented by the Watonala Lodge.  It supports the Scouting programs of the council through leadership, camping, and service.

===History===
On September 1, 1939, five adult [[Boy Scout]] leaders from the Pushmataha Area Council attended an [[Order of the Arrow]] Area Fellowship in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and learned about the purpose and mission of the Order.  Upon returning to the Pushmataha Area Council, an application for a charter was submitted to the National Order of the Arrow office.   The initial charter was issued in the latter part of September, 1939.

When the initial charter was issued, it was issued in the name of the local council, as Pushmataha Lodge.  In January, 1942, Pushmataha Lodge chose its Native American name, Watonala Lodge. In the [[Choctaw language]], Watonala means &quot;white egret&quot;, or &quot;white water bird&quot;.

The first lodge event was held in the Spring of 1940 at the [[Natchez Trace]] Game Preserve, near [[Houston, Mississippi]].  Lodge membership began to grow, as new [[Arrowmen]] were inducted during each council [[camporee]].  Membership slowed considerably during [[World War II]], but resumed its pre-war growth during the few years immediately following World War II.

The founding of Watonala Lodge in 1939 is well documented, although there is an [[oral history]] that places the origin of the lodge ten years earlier, in 1929.

===Service===
Watonala Lodge devotes much of its service time to development and maintenance of their home camp, [[Camp Seminole (Mississippi)|Camp Seminole]], which is located five miles north of [[Starkville, Mississippi]].  The lodge also publishes an online &quot;Where To Go Camping Guide&quot; at www.Watonala.Org, aimed at helping other Boy Scouts and the general public find good places to camp, canoe, and hike.

===Memorabilia===
The dominant theme of most Watonala patches and memorabilia is its [[totem]], the white egret. The totem is usually shown in profile, facing the viewer's left, and headed upward in flight.  There are numerous variations of this design, with the totem image varying slightly with each new patch issue.  The lodge issues a new lodge flap every two or three years, and sometimes issues specific patches for OA events, such as [[Conclave]],  National Order of the Arrow Conference ([[Order of the arrow#National Order of the Arrow Conference|NOAC]] ), and service events.

Compared to many OA lodges, Watonala Lodge has always been comparatively small in membership numbers.   This is due largely to being in a rural council having only ten counties.  Because of smaller membership, the quantity of Watonala memorabilia available is usually smaller than most OA lodges.

'''Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros''' is an American [[folk rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 2007. The group is led by singer [[Alex Ebert]]. The band's name is based on a story Ebert wrote in his youth, about a messianic figure named Edward Sharpe.  Drawing from [[roots rock]], [[folk rock|folk]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[psychedelic music]], the band's image and sound evoke the [[hippie movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s. The group's first show was played July 18, 2007, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood, California]]. Their first studio album, ''[[Up from Below]]'', was released on July 7, 2009, on Community Records and featured the popular single &quot;[[Home (Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros song)|Home]]&quot;. The group released their second full-length album, ''[[Here (Edward Sharpe album)|Here]]'', on May 29, 2012, and third album, ''[[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros (album)|Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]'', on July 23, 2013. Their fourth studio album, ''[[PersonA]]'', was released in April 2016.

Since its founding, the band has undergone several alterations. Most notably, singer Jade Castrinos left the band in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 June 2014 |author= Joe Youorski |title=Jade Castrinos Booted from Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/06/jade-castrinos-kicked-out-of-edward-sharpe-and-the.html |website= [[Paste Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Joe Youorski |title= Edward Sharpe And The Magnetic Zeros: Jade Quit, We Didn't Kick Her Out |url= https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/edward-sharpe-the-magnetic-zeros-jade-quit-we-didnt-kick-her-out/#/slide/1 |website= Musicfeeds.com.au |date= 25 March 2015 |quote= We asked her to take off one tour.

The band also operates Big Sun, a non-profit focused on funding and developing co-ops and land trusts in urban areas around the world. Their first large-scale project, &quot;Avalon Village,&quot; is in Highland Park (within Detroit), Michigan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==History==

===Origin and first studio album (Up From Below) ===
[[File:Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.JPG|thumb|left|The group performing in a park in 2009]]
After years of the [[Los Angeles]] party life and subsequent drug addiction, [[Ima Robot]] frontman [[Alex Ebert]] broke up with his girlfriend, moved out of his house, and spent time in [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=paste0909&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/09/edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros-cmon-get-happ.html |title=Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros: C'Mon Get Happy! :: Music :: Features :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=September 28, 2009 |access-date=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Ebert began to write a book about a [[Messiah|messianic figure]] named Edward Sharpe who was &quot;sent down to Earth to kinda heal and save mankind, but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love.&quot; Ebert adopted the Sharpe persona as his [[alter ego]]. He said, &quot;I don't want to put too much weight on it, because in some ways it's just a name that I came up with. But I guess if I look deeper, I do feel like I had lost my [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in general. I really didn't know what was going on or who I was anymore. Adopting another name helped me open up an avenue to get back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald |first=Scott |url=http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2009-11-06/concerts-music-clubs/edward-sharpe-aka-alex-ebert-finds-himself-with-the-magnetic-zeros#ixzz0rss1BuRA |title=Edward Sharpe, aka Alex Ebert, finds himself with The Magnetic Zeros |publisher=Sdnn.com |date=November 6, 2009 |access-date=August 23, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831180906/http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2009-11-06/concerts-music-clubs/edward-sharpe-aka-alex-ebert-finds-himself-with-the-magnetic-zeros| archive-date= August 31, 2010 | url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2009, Ebert, Castrinos, and a group of musicians toured the country by bus as Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros. The first show they played in 2009 was at the [[Marfa Film Festival]] in [[Marfa, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paste0909&quot;/&gt; The band recorded their debut album, ''[[Up from Below]]'', in Laurel Canyon. Produced by Nicolo Aglietti and Aaron Older, it was released on July 14, 2009. ''Up from Below'' is also the name of one of the songs in this album, in which Alex states &quot;I was only five/when my dad told me I'd die/I cried as he said son/ was nothing could be done&quot;. Says Alexander, &quot;My dad would be doing therapy in his office upstairs and I'd hear screamings, because they'd be role-playing and he'd be acting as his patient's father and they'd get upset and hit him and all this stuff. When he wasn't working, I'd go up there to draw and one day the music he was playing, Beethoven I think, delivered to me the idea of life and death. The information was bequeathed to me by the music. It was sonic and emotional. I tapped my dad on the shoulder and asked him if I was going to die and he said, 'Yeah.'&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;MyUser_The_Independent_June_5_2020c&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/second-coming-how-alexander-ebert-reinvented-himself-as-a-messianic-figure-called-edward-sharpe-2257504.html |title=Second coming: How Alexander Ebert reinvented himself as a messianic figure called Edward Sharpe |newspaper=The Independent |access-date= June 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Big Easy Express'' and second studio album (Here) ===
In April 2011, the band joined [[Mumford &amp; Sons]] and [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] on the [[Railroad Revival Tour]]. According to ''[[American Songwriter]]'', the tour stopped in six cities, playing alternative venues such as an Austin, Texas high school where Mumford &amp; Sons taught the marching band how to play their hit &quot;The Cave&quot;. The tour was also the subject of Grammy-nominated director [[The Malloys|Emmett Malloy]]'s latest documentary ''Big Easy Express'', which strove to capture &quot;the pure joy of music&quot; through Americana folk imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Moss|first=Marissa|title=Mumford &amp; Co. Chase The American Dream In Big Easy Express|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/mumford-co-chase-the-american-dream-in-big-easy-express/|access-date=June 5, 2012|magazine=American Songwriter|date=April 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary went on to win in the category for [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Best Long Form Music Video]] at the [[55th Annual Grammy Awards|2013 Grammy Awards]]. In 2011, Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford &amp; Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with &quot;This Train&quot;.

The group's second album, ''[[Here (Edward Sharpe album)|Here]]'', was released on May 29, 2012.

===Third studio album (Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros) ===
The band's self-titled third studio album, ''[[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros (album)|Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]'', was released in 2013. This was followed by tours of North America, UK, Europe, and Australia which included headlining concert dates as well as major festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwardsharpeandthemagneticzeros.com/news/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204844/http://edwardsharpeandthemagneticzeros.com/news/ |archive-date=August 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band became known for taking people onstage with them, including a former patient they had previously met in a hospital performance, and a disabled man in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name=&quot;transversomedia1&quot;/&gt;

===Fourth studio album (PersonA) ===
The band's fourth studio album, ''[[PersonA]]'', was released April 15, 2016 through Community Music. Recording the music almost entirely in one room together in [[New Orleans]], their approach was a far cry from their ramshackle, come-one-come-all production audible on recordings of their previous albums.

In an in-depth interview with [[Transverso Media]], Ebert explained his desire to evolve on ''PersonA'', stating, &quot;In a lot of ways this album does things that are missing.&quot; He went on to discuss why the name Edward Sharpe is crossed out on the cover, saying, &quot;There was no character to begin with, so why not kill him? He never really was there. If anything, and at most, Edward Sharpe was a vehicle for me to get to slough off whatever I had become up until that point, and to get back to or sort of allow my pure self to come forth into sort of a clean slate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;transversomedia1&quot;/&gt;

'''Cretteville''' is a former [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Manche]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Normandy (administrative region)|Normandy]] in north-western [[France]]. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the commune of [[Picauville]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2015/12/23/INTB1600493A/jo/texte Arrêté préfectoral] 23 December 2015 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After the liberation of the area by Allied Forces in 1944, engineers of the [[Ninth Air Force]] IX Engineering Command began construction of a combat [[Advanced Landing Ground]] outside of the town.  Declared operational on 4 July, the airfield was designated as &quot;[[Cretteville Airfield|A-14]]&quot;, it was used by the [[358th Fighter Group]] which flew [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s until mid-August when the unit moved into Central France. The [[406th Fighter Group]] took its place at the airfield and continued to fly P-47s until early September. Afterward, the airfield was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David C.

The '''Protection of Animals Act 1934''' was an act of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] effectively making [[rodeo]], as it then existed, illegal in England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Garner Robert (1993) ''Animals, Politics and Morality'' Manchester, UK, Manchester University Press, p.88, {{ISBN|0-7190-3574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was based upon the perceived cruelty to animals exhibited at western rodeos brought by promotions such as [[Tex Austin]]'s 1924 &quot;King of the Rodeo&quot; exhibition at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1924, the first such program in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;AH&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1972/3/1972_3_72_print.shtml Carson, Gerald (April 1972) &quot;The Late, Late Frontier&quot; ''American Heritage'' 23(3): p.75]&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was repealed and replaced by the [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]] and the [[Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006]] respectively.

==Analysis==
The first section provided that roping any unbroken horse or untrained bull was illegal.  This was followed by prohibitions on &quot;wrestling, fighting, or struggling with any untrained bull&quot;, and on stimulating a horse or bull to buck.  This last provision would exclude [[Girth (tack)|cinch straps]] specifically designed to irritate the animal or a strap cinched around its genitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;AH&quot;/&gt; The prohibitions applied not only to the riders and the [[stock contractor]]s preparing the animals, but to any promoter of the contests or exhibitions.

The penalties were fines of up to 100 pounds, or up to three months in gaol, per violation.

===Geographic scope===
The last section of the act provided that it was not effective for [[Northern Ireland]].

'''Åbo Svenska Teater''' ({{lang-fi|Turun ruotsalainen teatteri}}) is a [[Finland Swedish|Finland-Swedish]] theatre in the city of [[Turku]] in [[Finland]] and the oldest theatre in the country, founded in 1839. The building itself is also the oldest still functioning theatre house in Finland. The name means &quot;The Swedish theatre of Åbo&quot;; [[Åbo]] is the Swedish name of the city of Turku.

== History ==
Turku was the capital city of Finland during Finland's epoch as a part of [[Sweden]], and Swedish theatre companies visited Finland during the 18th-century, the first of whom was the [[Stenborg Troupe]] in 1761&lt;ref&gt;Tryggve Byström (1981). Svenska komedien 1737-1754. Borås: Centraltryckeriet AB. {{ISBN|91-1-813241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company of [[Carl Seuerling]] in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://runeberg.org/nfbh/0175.html 	 	Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 8. Feiss - Fruktmögel ]''&lt;/ref&gt; There where however, no proper theatre building until the ''[[Bonuviers Teater]]'' was erected in the 1810s. When the old theatre was destroyed during the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, there was a need of a new theater house.

===1839-1894===
The theatre has been located in its present building since 1839, when it was opened by a local amateur society with the play ''[[Gubben i Bergsbygden]]'' the 21 January 1839.  Later that same year, the theatre house was used by its first professional theatre company, that of [[Ulrik Torsslow]], and its first professional concert singer, [[Betty Boije]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1843, concerts by [[Johanna von Schoultz]] and [[Jenny Lind]] where both performed on its stage.&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1894, the theatre did not have a permanent staff, as Finland did not have any native actors at this point, and during the 19th-century the theatre house was used by travelling theatre companies from Sweden. The most notable of these were the company of [[Pierre Deland]], which visited the theatre regularly from 1840 to 1861, as well as the so called &quot;Finnish Company&quot; of [[Edvard Stjernström]], which enjoyed theatre monopoly in Southern Finland in 1850-53.&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s and 1880s, the famed Swedish company of [[Thérèse Elfforss]] frequnelty visited the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first native theatre company performed in the theatre was the company of [[August Westermark]] in 1872, though it was not to be until 1894, that the first performance was given by a permanent native ensemble at the theatre.

==Activity==
The theatre building is owned by [[Stiftelsen för Åbo Akademi]] and it is run by [[Åbo Svenska Teaterförening]].

The theatre has three formal stages; Stora Scenen, with 365 seats, Studioscenen with 136 seats, and Tiljan-scenen, with a maximum of one hundred seats, as well as local activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abosvenskateater.fi/sv/om_ast/scener/ Description of performance spaces], official site {{in lang|sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abd al-Karim Qasim==

An anonymous editor and I have been arguing whether some sources concerning the CIA's possible involvement with [[Saddam Hussein]]'s assassination attempt on [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] and also whether the CIA/Americans were also involved in the coup which overthrew him. I am not an expert on the subject, but I don't want a potential historical fact to be overlooked because someone doesn't like the sources (or possibly what they say). Could someone with more knowledge please also monitor this page and provide some extra guidance, or better still impeccable sources one way or the other. Thank you.

'''Donville-les-Bains''' ({{IPA-fr|dɔ̃vil le bɛ̃}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Manche]] [[Departments of France|department]], northwestern [[France]].

==Introduction==
Donville-les-Bains is located just outside Granville, a port on the Norman coast noted for ferry traffic to the Channel Islands. Rail service is available from Granville to Paris on a regular basis provided by SNCF, the French National Railway.

The town is also the origin of the English language surname Dunville/Dumville (originally Donville),{{cn|date=January 2017}} which is found throughout the UK and former British colonies.{{cn|date=January 2017}} People descended from this Norman line can be found in concentrations around Toronto, Thunder Bay, Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, and South Carolina.{{cn|date=January 2017}} (However, Dunville, Newfoundland was not named after Donville-les-Bains; Dunville was named after the founding Dunphy family.)

==Heraldry==
{{Blazon-arms
| img1=Blason Donville-les-Bains.svg|
| legend1=Arms of Donville-les-Bains
| text=&lt;small&gt;The arms of Donville-les-Bains are [[blazon]]ed :&lt;br /&gt;''Gules, a sea-horse [i.e. a mythical [[Hippocampus (mythology)|hippocampus]]], and in chief a sun of 8 points Or.''&lt;/small&gt;

My photo of 45rpm record label. The 1964 second UK release by James Brown on the Sue label.

== Licensing ==
{{Non-free album cover}}
==Fair Use Rationale for the article [[Night Train (Jimmy Forrest composition)]]==
*The label image is used to represent a single, &quot;[[Night Train (James Forrest composition)|Night Train]]&quot;, by a well-known musician, [[James Brown]] 
*The image is of low resolution
*The image does not limit the performer or record company's ability to sell the song or single
*The only purpose of the image is to help describe the single &quot;[[Night Train (James Forrest composition)|Night Train]]&quot; and no other purpose

'''Stick Against Stone''' is a [[Post-punk]] / [[No wave|No Wave]] band from [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; that later resided in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[Eugene, Oregon]] and [[San Francisco]], [[California]] and remained active (in no less than six incarnations) between 1981 and 1990.  The group returned to performing in 2011 and currently resides in the [[New York City]] area.

Since their founding, the band went through several line-up changes, but never released a full album until 2010 – and it wasn't until the 2014 release of ''[http://stickagainststone.com/catalog/oregon-bootleg-tapes-live/ The Oregon Bootleg Tapes - Live]'' (a live recording from 1985) that critical attention finally arrived in the form of positive reviews in [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The To Do List|url = http://nymag.com/nymag/culture/to-do/to-do-2014-7-14/index1.html|website = NYMag.com|publisher=New York Magazine|access-date=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First Listen: &quot;Instant&quot; From Stick Against Stone's The Oregon Bootleg Tapes|url = http://www.vibe.com/2014/05/first-listen-stick-against-stone-oregon-bootleg-tapes/|website = Vibe|date = 16 May 2014|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wax Poetics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.waxpoetics.com/wax-poetics-magazine/wax-poetics-issue-60-blondie-bw-sza/|title = Wax Poetics #60|date = |access-date = 2020-01-16|website = |publisher = |last = Gale|first = Ezra}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuepoint]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Christgau:Expert Witness: Baseball Project / Hamell on Trial / Richmond Fontaine / Delines /Stick Against Stone /Ry Cooder /Modern Baseball, (Yep Roc), (New West), (El Cortez '02)|url = https://medium.com/cuepoint/robert-christgau-expert-witness-25b726055213#.cvmhzgtkm|website = Medium|date = 2014-10-24|access-date = 2016-02-07|first = Robert|last = Christgau}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Robert Christgau]]) and [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; where writer Miles Raymer remarked about the group: ''“They had their eyes on the 'there and then', but they were playing 20 years into the future.”''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stick Against Stone: The Oregon Bootleg Tapes|url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19364-stick-against-stone-the-oregon-bootleg-tapes/|website = Pitchfork|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhineland-Palatinate state-owned stud facilities of Zweibrücken house the smallest number of state stallions&lt;ref name=eylers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horse-gate.com/landgestuete/cgi-bin/lgdcl.pl?zweibrucken&amp;en |title=Rhineland-Palatinate State Stud of Zweibruecken |publisher=Eylers |work=State Studs of Germany |access-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015172208/http://www.horse-gate.com/landgestuete/cgi-bin/lgdcl.pl?zweibrucken&amp;en |archive-date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, but the region's horse-breeding history is rich. The modern city of [[Zweibrücken]], meaning &quot;two bridges&quot;, was a county throughout the Middle Ages and then later on became a [[duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The state stud was founded in 1755 by [[Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken|Duke Christian IV]] following a visit to England. While abroad he admired the refined, spirited English [[Thoroughbred]]s, as a breed less than 100 years old at the time. When Christian IV returned to Zweibrücken, he financed the establishment of &quot;royal facilities&quot; throughout the region, populating them with noble [[stallion]]s and [[mare]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;eylers&quot;/&gt;

Christian IV's successor, [[Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken|Charles II August]], continued to improve horse-breeding in [[Electorate of the Palatinate|politically influential]] Zweibrücken by decreeing that the horses bred there ought to be &quot;good, handsome and useful&quot;. This goal was achieved to the effect of gaining the admiration of the [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King of Prussia]], who purchased over 150 Zweibrücken stallions. These sires were sent to the Principal Stud of Trakehnen where the [[Trakehner]] was bred for use by the Prussian nobles.&lt;ref name=&quot;eylers&quot;/&gt;

In 1801, Zweibrücken was annexed by France, and the noble horses were moved to Rosiers aux Salines.&lt;ref name=&quot;eylers&quot;/&gt; However, [[Napoleon]] saw the stallion and mare herds at Zweibrücken Principal Stud re-established in 1806. The central facility and its many outposts and stallion depots were populated with more than 250 stallions and a herd of over 100 mares purchased from notable German breeding outfits, as well as fashionable Spanish horses and products of the formidable [[Austro-Hungarian empire]]. Less than a decade later, Zweibrücken was given to [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]], and Zweibrücken was retitled in 1890 as the Principal Royal Bavarian State Stud. During this period, large numbers of [[Anglo-Norman horse|Anglo-Normans]] - [[Thoroughbred]]-influenced agricultural horses from France - and [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] were stationed in Zweibrücken.&lt;ref name=&quot;eylers&quot;/&gt; The first organized breeding of [[Anglo-Arabian]] horses occurred at Zweibrücken during this time period.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The region became widely known for its refined [[cavalry]] horses which combined the size and speed of the [[Thoroughbred]] with the more tractable temperament of the [[Arabian (horse)|Arabian]]. By 1900, the Principal Stud of Zweibrücken comprised more than 250 head of breeding stock and young horses, 74 of which were state-owned stallions.

The first half of the 20th century was marked by increasing demands for a heavier all-purpose farm horse, which were used extensively in the [[World War I|first World War]] for pulling artillery wagons. Consequently, the refined riding horses were replaced by heavy warmbloods from [[Ostfriesen and Alt-Oldenburger|Oldenburg]]. During World War II, the entire city was evacuated and the horses brought to [[Bavaria]]. Much of the city was destroyed, and the state stud facilities came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed German federal state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Nearly a quarter of the 58 stallions standing at Zweibrücken were [[draft horse]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;eylers&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Landgestüt Zweibrücken.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The State Stud of Zweibrücken]]

Zweibrücken lost the status of Principal Stud - which keeps a herd of mares in addition to standing stallions - in 1960. As the demand for an athletic riding horse blossomed, the draft horse stallions were replaced by [[Trakehner]]s. From 1966 to 1976, Trakehner stallions comprised half the stallion roster.&lt;ref name=&quot;eylers&quot;/&gt; Unlike most of the State Studs of Germany, the period for which Zweibrücken stood [[heavy warmblood]] stallions was brief; the chief focus of this region has been steadily focused on an elegant riding horse since its construction. Gradually, sires from [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]] and [[Holstein (horse)|Holsteiner]] bloodlines joined the noble Trakehners, accelerating the local horse-breeding efforts towards the production of a [[warmblood]] [[sport horse|riding horse]].

Today many of the stallion depots and outposts lie in France, while others were purchased by separate entities. Most notable among these was the facility at Birkhausen, which was bought by the [[Trakehner]] ''verband'' and from which Abiza, dam of the Canadian-born Trakehner [[Abdullah (horse)|Abdullah]], was sold. The grounds of the state stud host stallion parades and the month-long stallion performance test for the regional breeding association.

==Breeding==

{{See also|studbook selection}}

Organized breeding through much of the history of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland was managed by the State Stud. The Horse Breeders' Association of Rhineland-Palatinate-Saar (PRPS) was formed in 1977 and directs the breeding of almost all horse breeds within the region. The breed with the largest population within the studbooks is the German Riding or Sport Horse, called the Zweibrücker. The PRPS cooperates with similar associations in [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], collectively licensing and approving breeding stock.

Like other German Warmbloods, the breeding of Zweibrücken is characterized by stringent inspection criteria. Foals do not receive their papers until they are presented at a local foal show, at which judges may exclude any foal if it is markedly off-type. Along with their papers, the foals receive a brand on the left hind leg, just behind the [[stifle]]. Foal inspections also give an early indication of the quality of the sire, as well as which mares match best with him. At the age of 3, fillies may be upgraded from the foal register to the herd book through a process called ''Stutbuchaufnahmen'' or &quot;Marebook Recording&quot;. There are several levels of mare book based on the quality of the mare and the completeness of her pedigree, which allows mares of unorthodox breeding to eventually become part of the breeding program. To be written into the herd book and thereby have registered foals, the mare is evaluated on her [[equine conformation|conformation]] and [[horse gaits|gaits]]. Mares which fail to meet the criteria may be placed in a lower mare book, or be denied altogether. Only mares in the highest mare books can produce breeding stallion sons.

While mares can be entered into the studbook at local shows, the process of having a young stallion approved for breeding is lengthy. Stallion candidates are often identified as foals, and at the age of 2 and a half the best colts attend the licensing in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]]. There they are evaluated along with stallion hopefuls - ''köraspirants'' - branded [[Bavarian Warmblood]], [[Württemberger]] and Saxony-Thuringian, along with some representatives from other regions. As all of these regions have a common goal in warmblood breeding, they are judged to the same standard. They are evaluated in terms of their conformational correctness, type, gaits and ability free-jumping. The best young stallions receive a temporary license which is accepted by all of the south-German breeding associations. The stallion has a period of a few years during which he must prove himself in performance, and in this way he earns full approval.

This process is common to all German Warmbloods, and is quite similar to the studbook selection process used for other Warmbloods, as well.

==Characteristics==

The best way to identify a Zweibrücker is by the brand on the left hind leg. It features the two bridges of the city of Zweibrücken topped by a representation of the duke's crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPSI&quot;/&gt; Otherwise, it is not possible to distinguish a Zweibrücker from a German Warmblood bred elsewhere based solely on appearance. All German Warmblood registries exchange genetic material in an effort to continuously improve their own horses.

Most Zweibrücken are middle-weight horses with &quot;old style&quot; examples heavier set than those deemed &quot;modern&quot; in type. The ideal height is 160 to 170&amp;nbsp;cm or 15.3 to 16.3hh at the age of 3, but deviations in either direction are not uncommon nor are they disqualifying.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRPS&quot;/&gt; The most common colors are [[Bay (horse)|bay]], [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], [[Gray (horse)|gray]], and [[Black (horse)|black]], however several breeders of colored warmbloods have chosen to register their horses as Zweibrücken, so there are [[tobiano]] pintos and colors such as [[palomino]], [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]], and [[cremello]]. &lt;!--The rules on the German website explicitly say &quot;no cremellos&quot; but they obviously approved Mascarpone GF and have registered and approved his daughters etc. so I'm not sure where to go with that.--&gt;

The Anglo-Arabian ancestry of the Zweibrücker is found primarily in what remains of its old female families.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRPS&quot;/&gt; Today, the Horse Breeders' Association of Rhineland-Palatinate-Saar is known for its liberal pedigree policies, accepting breeding stock from most other [[warmblood]] studbooks which are members of the [[World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses]].

[[File:Meredithmbeerbaum lemans chioaachen07.JPG|thumb|A Zweibrücker horse performing show jumping]]
The breeding objective, based on market demands, is currently a horse suitable for [[dressage]], [[show jumping|jumping]], and [[eventing]], though [[combined driving]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRPS&quot;/&gt; In North America, the breeding objective includes suitability for [[show hunter]] competition, as well.

Zweibrücken share the standard of German Riding or Sport Horse with their parallels in other regions. Ideally, the horse is characterized by a noble expression, with long-lined and correct [[Equine conformation|conformation]]. The head is dry, expressive, and aesthetically appealing though need not have out of the ordinary refinement. The topline is long, generous, and slightly curved featuring a medium-length neck set on rather high, a stark, laid-back wither and long sloping shoulder. The loin is well-muscled, the croup is long, slightly tilted, and muscular. The horse stands on a foundation of dry, large joints and correct limbs ending in correct, hard hooves of sufficient size.

In motion the gaits are correct - no deviations when viewed from the front or rear - and expansive with a pure rhythm and suggestive of great work ethic. The qualities of freedom, elasticity, and power are paramount.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101231114/http://www.rhpsi.com/pdf/rpsi_bylaws.pdf|archive-date=1 November 2006 |url=http://www.rhpsi.com/pdf/rpsi_bylaws.pdf |title=Statutes and Bylaws |work=Rheinland Pfalz-Saar International |publisher=RHPSI |format=PDF |access-date=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walk swings through the neck and back, while the trot is cadenced and powerful. Suspension and elasticity are effects of the ability of the horse's joints to store energy and absorb shock, thus are influential in soundness.&lt;ref name=&quot;rules&quot;/&gt; The canter is important as an indicator of jumping suitability, and should be cadenced, balanced and powerful.

Zweibrücken, especially stallions, are typically evaluated over fences through [[free jumping]], where the horse is let loose in a chute with specifically measured obstacles. This allows judges to draw conclusions about the horse's jumping abilities without pushing them too fast under saddle. Judges look for a horse which is capable of jumping, having an appearance of ease and confidence as he jumps, without any carelessness. The rhythm of the canter should remain unchanged while the horse adjusts his stride length to leave the ground from the correct place. The fore and hind limbs should be drawn up close to the body, which should pass close to the obstacle, while the spine forms a convex arc over the jump called &quot;[[bascule (horse)|bascule]]&quot;.

As part of the approval process, stallions and often mares are evaluated in controlled conditions on their personality traits or &quot;interior qualities&quot;. This information allows breeders to choose mates properly. The horses with the best marks for interior qualities have kind, personable temperaments, are uncomplicated to ride, strong-nerved and reliable but alert and intelligent. Another quality, called &quot;rideability&quot;, is a measure of how comfortable and simple the horse is to ride. High rideability is coveted by amateur riders in particular.

'''Albert Preston Dailey''' (June 16, 1939 – June 26, 1984) was an American [[jazz]] pianist.

==Early life==
Dailey was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. His parents were Albert Preston Dailey Sr, and Gertrude Johnson Dailey.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Jon Pareles, [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/obituaries/albert-dailey-46-jazz-pianist.html &quot;Albert Dailey, 46, Jazz Pianist&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 3, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He began studying piano as a child, and his first professional appearances were with the house band of the [[Royal Theatre (Baltimore)|Baltimore Royal Theater]] in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Wynn,
 [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6363/biography|pure_url=yes}} Albert Dailey biography] at [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the decade, he studied at [[Morgan State University]] and the [[Peabody Conservatory]].

==Later life and career==
He backed [[Damita Jo DuBlanc]] on tour from 1960 to 1963, and following this briefly put together his own trio in [[Washington, D.C.]], playing at the [[Bohemian Caverns]]. In 1964, he moved to [[New York City]], where he played with [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Roy Haynes]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Charles Mingus]], and [[Freddie Hubbard]]. In 1967, he played with [[Woody Herman]] at the [[Monterey Jazz Festival]], and played intermittently with [[Art Blakey]]'s Jazz Messengers from 1968 to 1969.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In the 1970s, Dailey played with [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Elvin Jones]], and [[Archie Shepp]]. In the 1980s, he undertook concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was a member of the [[Upper Manhattan Jazz Society]] with [[Charlie Rouse]], [[Benny Bailey]], and [[Buster Williams]].

Dailey died in Denver on June 26, 1984, aged 45.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maggin |first=Donald L. |date=1996 |title=Stan Getz: A Life in Jazz |location=New York City|publisher=William Morrow |isbn=0688123155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Adventures of Superman'' episodes}}
[[Image:Superman Title Cards.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Series intertitles in black and white (1952–54) and color (1955–58).]]
This is a list of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' episodes. Much of the [[Superman]] &quot;formula&quot;, in all forms of its media presentations, involves Superman rescuing someone, either one or more of his colleagues or another person or persons. In those cases, success is largely a matter of Superman simply &quot;getting there on time&quot; to save the day. Some of the strongest episodes in the series tend to be the ones where Superman himself is in peril, either because of exposure to the presence of kryptonite, external forces, or some other daunting challenge.

Several episodes raise the threat of exposing Superman's secret identity as [[Clark Kent]]. The only humans to know for sure, other than Clark's adoptive mother, are a few villains in some episodes whose discovery leads them to their deaths before they can tell anyone else. Two animals, a dog named Corky and a burro named Carmelita, also know Kent and Superman are one and the same. The only other entity to know, apparently, is a computer.

The first two seasons, comprising 52 episodes and half of the series' whole, were filmed in [[Black and white#Media|black and white]]. In 1954, series producer Whitney Ellsworth insisted on filming in [[Color television|color]], as some home viewers were beginning to purchase color television sets. However, these episodes were still transmitted in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/article/barely-a-superhero-show-iadventures-of-superman-iw-98758 &quot;Barely a superhero show, Adventures Of Superman was a surprise success&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scivally|first=Bruce|title=Superman on Film, Television, Radio and Broadway|year=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3166-3|pages=55–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCKfBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=adventures+of+superman+shot+in+color&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also beginning with season three, the series began to take on the lighthearted, whimsical tone of the ''Superman'' comic books of the 1950s. The villains were often caricatured, [[Damon Runyon|Runyonesque]] [[gangsters]] played with tongue in cheek. Violence on the show was toned down further. The only gunfire that occurred was aimed at Superman, and of course the bullets bounced off. Superman was less likely to engage in fisticuffs with the villains. On occasions when Superman did use physical force, he would take crooks out in a single karate-style chop or, if he happened to have two criminals in hand, banging their heads together. More often than not, the villains were likely to knock ''themselves'' out fleeing Superman. By then very popular to viewers, [[Jimmy Olsen]] was now being played as the show's [[comic foil]] to Superman. Many of the plots featured him and [[Lois Lane]] being captured, only to be rescued at the last minute by Superman.

Scripts for the last season did not always hit the campy lows of the previous two years and reestablished a bit of the seriousness of the show, often with science fiction elements such as a Kryptonite-powered robot (a left-over prop from &quot;The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters&quot;), atomic explosions, and impregnable metal cubes. In one of the last episodes, &quot;The Perils of Superman&quot; (a takeoff on ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]''), there was indeed deadly peril straight out of the movie serials: Lois gagged and tied to a set of railroad tracks with a speeding train bearing down on her, [[Perry White]] nearly sawed in half while tied to a log, Jimmy in a runaway car headed for a cliff, and Clark Kent immersed in a vat of acid. This was one of three episodes directed by [[George Reeves]] himself in an attempt to inject some new life into the series. Noel Neill's hair was dyed a bright red for this season, though the color change was not apparent in the initial black-and-white broadcasts. Although Reeves's efforts did not save the series from cancellation, &quot;The Perils of Superman&quot; is regarded by some as one of the best episodes. The numbering scheme in the following list is derived from the purely consecutive numbering used in ''Superman: Serial to Cereal''.

Police believe that Garrett will wait patiently for his probation to be up to use the money to finance a new criminal empire. The gangster is not talking to reporters about anything. However, Daily Planet editor Perry White is willing to pay an extra month's salary to either Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen or Clark Kent if one of them can land an exclusive interview with Garrett. Lois and Jimmy have every intention of scooping Clark. Should they get Lank Garrett to talk, the Planet could have one of the biggest articles ever printed. On the other hand, Jimmy and Lois could wind up in the middle of yet another dangerous situation that will require Superman's help.

As Daily Planet cub reporter Jimmy Olsen is about to sit in Tony's chair for a haircut, notorious gangster Rick Sable cuts in front of him for a shave. Tony realizes that he and Rick grew up together as Jimmy listens and waits. He gets a tip that Sable intends to rob the Acme Jewelry Company at noon. Running to a nearby diner, Jimmy calls Clark Kent in hopes of getting Superman on the case. Kent thinks nothing of what Jimmy heard, but he promises that Superman will be on the alert.

Grandpa Jackson is not so happy, for Bobby has given away his Prince Albert coat, which had the old man's life savings of ten thousand dollars in cash hidden in the lining.

In the meantime, Vice-President Obreon is conspiring with cabinet member Philippe Gonzalez. A briefcase containing a bomb has been placed in Patillo's office. It is to go off at noon. Once the device eliminates the president, Obreon can take his place and rule with an iron fist.

Both the Daily Planet and Superman are actively involved in the Children's Camp Fund, and Pebble has some land that would be perfect for the charity's use. Money for the site will come from a silver mine that Pebble has named Superman Silver Mine in honor of the Man of Steel. This news could most certainly make the youngsters of Metropolis very happy. Gangster Dan Dobey and his henchman Boris have been in a slump lately. However, Lois Lane's article on Harrison Pebble and the Superman Silver Mine in the Planet give them an idea. Dobey is a dead ringer for Pebble. The only differences are Dobey has no mustache, and he has a metal plate in his head from an injury to his skull in an automobile accident. Dan Dobey could pass himself off as Pebble without any problems. Should he be able to do so, the Superman Silver Mine and its wealth could fall into the criminal's greedy hands.

To save his secret identity, Clark says that he traveled in two other moments about which Lois didn't know. In the meantime, Carmelita even guesses Jimmy's age correctly. The burro may very well be telepathic. This could lead to her and Pepe being involved in the most intense adventure of their lives with Superman.

The '''Battle of Ridgefield''' was a battle and a series of skirmishes between American and British forces during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The main battle was fought in the village of [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], on April 27, 1777.  More skirmishing occurred the next day between Ridgefield and the coastline near [[Westport, Connecticut]].

On April 25, 1777, a British force landed between [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] (now Westport) under the command of [[List of colonial governors of New York|New York's Royal Governor]] Major General [[William Tryon]]. They marched to [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], where they destroyed [[Continental Army]] supplies after chasing off a small garrison of troops.  Word spread concerning the British troop movements, and Connecticut militia leaders sprang into action.  Major General [[David Wooster]], Brigadier General [[Gold Selleck Silliman]], and Brigadier General [[Benedict Arnold]] raised a combined force of roughly 700 Continental Army regular and irregular local militia forces to oppose the raiders, but they could not reach Danbury in time to prevent the destruction of the supplies.  Instead, they set out to harass the British on their return to the coast.

The company led by General Wooster twice attacked Tryon's rear guard during their march south on April 27. Wooster was mortally wounded in the second encounter, and he died five days later.  The main encounter then took place at Ridgefield, where several hundred militia under Arnold's command confronted the British; they were driven away in a running battle down the town's main street, but not before inflicting casualties on the British.  Additional militia forces arrived, and the next day they continued to harass the British as they returned to [[Compo, Connecticut|Compo Point]] on the beach in Westport where the fleet awaited them.  Arnold regrouped the militia and some artillery to make a stand against the British near their landing site, but his position was flanked and his force scattered by artillery fire and a bayonet charge.

The expedition was a tactical success for the British forces, but the raid galvanized [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] support in Connecticut.

The state of [[Connecticut]] was not a scene of conflict during the first two years of the [[American Revolutionary War]], even though the war had begun in neighboring [[Massachusetts]] in April 1775, and [[New York City]] had been taken by the British in the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]] in the fall of 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, pp. 36, 46, 126–127, 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, pp. 202–253&lt;/ref&gt; Major General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] commanded the British forces in New York, and he drafted a plan for 1777 in which the primary goal was to take the American capital at [[Philadelphia]].  Troops left to defend New York were to include a brigade of 3,000 provincial troops under the command of New York's former royal governor [[William Tryon]], who was given a temporary promotion to &quot;major general of the provincials&quot; in spring 1777.&lt;ref name=N150/&gt;  Howe's plan included authorizing Tryon to operate on the [[Hudson River]] or to &quot;enter Connecticut as circumstances may point out.&quot;&lt;ref name=N150&gt;Nelson (1990), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  Tryon was given one of the early operations of the season, a raid against a [[Continental Army]] depot at [[Danbury, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=W492/&gt;  Howe had learned of the depot's existence through a spy working for British Indian agent [[Guy Johnson]],&lt;ref name=B141&gt;Burr (1906), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and he had also met with some success in an earlier raid against the Continental Army outpost at [[Peekskill, New York]].&lt;ref name=Burr142&gt;Burr (1906), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

A fleet was assembled consisting of 12 transports, a hospital ship, and some small craft, all under the command of Captain [[Henry Duncan (Royal Navy officer, 1735-1814)|Henry Duncan]].&lt;ref name=ridgefield&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Keith M|title=The Battle of Ridgefield|publisher=Town of Ridgefield, Connecticut|url=http://www.ridgefieldct.org/content/42/249/1077.aspx|access-date=2010-05-05|ref=Jones|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725192648/http://www.ridgefieldct.org/content/42/249/1077.aspx|archive-date=2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The landing force consisted of 1,500 regulars drawn from the [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)|4th]], [[East Yorkshire Regiment|15th]], [[Royal Welch Fusiliers|23rd]], [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th]], [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th]], and [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot|64th]] regiments, 300 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s from the [[Prince of Wales' American Regiment|Prince of Wales American Regiment]] led by [[Montfort Browne]], and a small contingent of the [[17th Lancers|17th Light Dragoon]]s, all led by Generals [[Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet|Sir William Erskine]] and [[James Agnew (British Army officer)|James Agnew]].&lt;ref name=W492/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case (1927), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Command of the entire operation was given to General Tryon, and the fleet sailed from New York on April 22, 1777.&lt;ref name=W492&gt;Ward (1952), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danbury depot had been established in 1776 by order of the [[Second Continental Congress]], and it primarily served forces located in the Hudson River valley.&lt;ref name=Ives429&gt;Ives (1900), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1777, the army began mustering regiments for that year's campaigns, and there were about 50 Continental Army soldiers and 100 local militia at Danbury under the command of [[Joseph Platt Cooke]], a local resident and a colonel in the state militia.&lt;ref name=Ives431&gt;Ives (1900), p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danbury==
Commodore Duncan anchored his fleet on April 25 at the mouth of the [[Saugatuck River]] and landed Tryon's troops on the eastern shore at a place called [[Compo, Connecticut|Compo Point]] in [[Westport, Connecticut]], which was still part of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey61&quot;/&gt;  They moved inland about {{convert|8|mi|km}} and camped in [[Weston, Connecticut|Weston]], and they reached Danbury early the next afternoon.  All along the march, militia fired on them, attempting to slow their advance.  They drove off Cooke's troops, who had been attempting to remove supplies, killing at least three and capturing at least two in skirmishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey67_9&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), pp. 67, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Before their departure early the next morning, the British destroyed 4,000 to 5,000 barrels of pork, beef, and flour, 5,000 pairs of shoes, 2,000 bushels of grain, and 1,600 tents, among other supplies; the troops also consumed significant quantities of rum.  The tory houses had marks on their chimneys to avoid the torch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey69&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The British fleet was first spotted when it passed [[Norwalk, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey61&quot;/&gt;  When the troops landed, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] messengers were dispatched to warn Danbury and local militia leaders of the movements.  Major General [[David Wooster]] and Brigadier General [[Benedict Arnold]] were in New Haven when messengers reached them on April 26, and Wooster immediately sent the local militia to [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]].  When he and Arnold reached Fairfield, they learned that General Silliman, the commander of the Fairfield County militia, had already departed for [[Redding, Connecticut|Redding]] with orders that any militia raised should follow as rapidly as possible.  Wooster and Arnold immediately moved in that direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey61&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Silliman assembled a force numbering about 500 militia members and 100 Continental Army regulars.&lt;ref name=W494&gt;Ward (1952), p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;  The alarm was broadcast as far as Peekskill, where [[Alexander McDougall]] began mobilizing Continental Army troops garrisoned there to intercept Tryon in case he entered [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name=Martin317&gt;Martin (1997), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;  The force then moved out, heading toward Danbury in a pouring rain.  By 11 pm, they had only reached [[Bethel, Connecticut]], about {{convert|2|mi|0}} short of Danbury.  Their gunpowder was wet, making battle impossible, so they spent the night there rather than pressing on to Danbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey63&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ridgefield==

Tryon was alerted to the presence of the Americans in Bethel around 1 am on April 27, cutting short thoughts of remaining for another day in Danbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey72&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Rousing the troops, he ordered the houses of Patriots to be burned; in all, more than twenty structures were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey72_3&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;  The troops then left Danbury around dawn, and marched south toward the village of [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] in an attempt to avoid General Wooster's force.  Hoping to delay General Tryon until overwhelming reinforcements arrived, General Wooster split his force. The main body, about 400 men, went with Generals Arnold and Silliman across the countryside to Ridgefield, where they were met by another 100 militiamen, and erected crude [[barricade]]s on the road through town.  General Wooster personally chased after the British column with the remaining 200;  his effort was assisted by local Patriots who created impediments before the British column, including the destruction of at least one bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey75&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Wooster engaged Tryon's rear guard as it paused for breakfast about {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of the town of Ridgefield, killing at least two British soldiers.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt; Wooster took about forty prisoners in this first engagement, and then retreated for cover in nearby woods.  He struck again an hour later, but the British were more prepared for a second engagement, having positioned three artillery pieces with their rear guard, spraying the colonials with grape shot.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt; Rallying his men, the 67-year-old General Wooster was mortally wounded moments after yelling &quot;Come on my boys! Never mind such random shots!&quot; about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Ridgefield's town center; his inexperienced militia dissolved in confusion.&lt;ref name=Burr147&gt;Burr (1906), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  Wooster died five days later in Danbury at the home of Nehemiah Dibble, whose house had also served as General Tryon's temporary quarters in Danbury.  Wooster's last words were reported to be &quot;I am dying, but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence.&quot;&lt;ref name=wooster&gt;{{Cite web |last=Locher |first=Paul |title=Gen.

The British column arrived at the base of Arnold's barricade at the northern end of Ridgefield's town center sometime after noon.  Following an hour-long artillery barrage of the barricade, Tryon dispatched flanking parties to test both sides of the American position.&lt;ref name=W494/&gt; Having anticipated this move, General Silliman posted forces at both flanks that blunted initial thrusts.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt; Outnumbering the Patriot forces by more than three to one, Tryon chose to advance on all three fronts including a 600-man column under covering artillery fire against the barricade itself under the leadership of General Erskine.  Tryon directed General Agnew to send out flankers, whose [[enfilade|enfilading]] fire helped breach the barricade.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt; The British then pursued the Patriot forces in a running battle the length of Town Street, and gained control of the town. With 12 dead and 24 wounded, the Americans withdrew under General Arnold's orders.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt;  After the barricade was breached, Arnold was positioned between his men and an advancing enemy platoon when his horse was struck by nine musket shots.  The horse went down, and Arnold was pinned and tangled in its trappings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey81&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; A British soldier charged him shouting for Arnold to surrender.  Arnold shouted &quot;Not Yet&quot; and shot and killed the soldier.  He then ran off with his troops with a slightly injured leg.  This entire engagement took around fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey78&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

After encamping for the night just south of Ridgefield, the British forces departed the next morning, leaving six houses and the Episcopal church (a Patriot supply depot and field hospital) in flames.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt;  During the night, the militia had regrouped under the command of Continental Army Colonel [[Jedediah Huntington]], and were expanded to about 500 men by the arrival of more militia from Connecticut, as well as a militia force from neighboring [[Dutchess County, New York]] led by Colonel [[Henry Ludington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey79&quot;/&gt; This force engaged in a swarming harassment of the British column as it moved south that resembled the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|British retreat from Concord]] at the start of the war.  From behind convenient stone walls, trees, and buildings the militia constantly fired at the British column as it headed back toward Compo Beach.&lt;ref name=W494/&gt;

In the meantime, General Arnold had gathered about 500 reinforcements further south, including a small company of Continental artillery led by Colonel [[John Lamb (general)|John Lamb]].  Arnold adopted a strong position on Compo Hill that commanded the roads leading across the Saugatuck River toward the beach, and waited for the British to arrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey79&quot;/&gt;  Tryon's force forded the Saugatuck River well above Arnold's position.  This prompted Arnold and the chasing militia, now led by General Silliman, to attempt an entrapment of the British before they reached the beach.  However, the British column, moving at full speed, was able to gain the high ground, and was joined by some fresh marines landed from the ships to provide cover for the embarkation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey79&quot;/&gt;  Arnold then prepared his force to attack the British, but a well-timed bayonet charge by Erskine's men broke the formation in spite of determined action by Lamb's artillery and Arnold's attempts to rally the troops.  During the skirmish, Arnold had a second horse shot out under him, and Lamb was injured.  The British successfully embarked and sailed for New York.&lt;ref name=W495/&gt;

The official British report listed 26 killed, 117 wounded, and 29 missing.&lt;ref&gt;Beatson (1804), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Pennsylvania Journal'' reported on May 14, 1777 that the British casualties were 14 enlisted men killed, with 10 officers and 80 enlisted men wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;MooreI427&quot;&gt;Moore (1860), p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Gazette'' of May 19, 1777 published a Patriot account stating that 40 British prisoners were taken by the Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;MooreI427&quot;/&gt; Douglas Southall Freeman gave the British loss as 154 killed and wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boatner316&quot;&gt;Boatner (1966), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans were reported to lose about 20 killed, with between 40 and 80 wounded,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boatner316&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=W495&gt;Ward (1952), p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; although the British claimed in their reports that more than 100 Americans were killed, and over 250 were wounded.  They also incorrectly reported that Colonel Lamb was killed; his injuries were severe enough that he appeared to be dead on the field.&lt;ref&gt;Beatson (1804), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Benedict arnold illustration.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|General [[Benedict Arnold]]]]

Although Tryon's raid on Danbury and actions in Ridgefield were tactical British successes, the resistance by American forces and a consequent rise in American military enrollments in the area deterred the British from ever again attempting a landing by ship to attack inland colonial strongholds during the war.  The British also would never again conduct inland operations in Connecticut, despite western Connecticut's strategic importance in securing the [[Hudson River Valley]].&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt;

The British destroyed at least 19 houses and 22 stores and barns, along with many military and medical supplies.  The town estimated that the expedition caused more than £16,000 in damage, and submitted claims to Congress for recompense.  Congress issued a payment of £500 to the town selectmen in response.  Further applications were made to the state's General Assembly in 1787, which resulted in the awarding of land in the [[Ohio Country]] that now includes [[Sandusky, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey91_3&quot;&gt;Bailey (1896), pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The raid increased support in the area for the Patriot cause, thus negating the short-term gains by Tryon against Patriots in territory that had previously been neutral. Soon after Tryon sailed away from Compo Beach, approximately 3,000 Connecticut citizens joined the [[Connecticut Army of Reserve]].  In May, Lieutenant Colonel [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return Jonathan Meigs]] led a [[Meigs Raid|reprisal raid]] from Connecticut against a British position in [[Sag Harbor, New York]].&lt;ref name=Mather226&gt;Mather (1913), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  Connecticut later sent a company of cavalry and two full regiments to assist Major General [[Horatio Gates]] in the defeat of Lieutenant General [[John Burgoyne]] at the pivotal [[Battles of Saratoga]] in September and October 1777, and sent militia companies to assist in the defense of the Hudson at Peekskill.&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Historical Society (1997), pp. 271, 504&lt;/ref&gt;  Tryon [[Tryon's raid|again raided]] Connecticut in 1779, but the expedition was limited to raiding port towns.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson (1990), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  The last major raiding expedition the British conducted was ironically led by Benedict Arnold after he changed sides; his 1781 raid on [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] included [[Battle of Groton Heights|stiff resistance by the militia at Groton Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1997),  p. 530&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict Arnold was well rewarded for his role in the affair.  He had planned, after visiting his family in New Haven, to travel to Philadelphia to protest to the [[Second Continental Congress]] the promotion of other, more junior officers, to [[major general (United States)|major general]] ahead of him.  In recognition for his role at Ridgefield he received a promotion to major general, although his command seniority over those other officers was not restored.  He was also awarded a horse &quot;properly caparisoned as a token of ... approbation of his gallant conduct ... in the late enterprize to Danbury.&quot;&lt;ref name=W495/&gt;  (Arnold's seniority was restored after his important contributions to the success at Saratoga.)&lt;ref name=Martin411&gt;Martin (1997), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sybil Ludington's ride==
{{main|Sybil Ludington}}

[[Sybil Ludington]] was the 16-year-old daughter of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County's]] [[Colonial militia]] Colonel Henry Ludington, renown for her night-long ride to alert Patriot troops of the Danbury raid.  Modern scholars say there is little evidence backing the story, which originated in a brief mention in the colonel's 1907 memoirs published privately by his grandchildren,&lt;ref name= Hunt&gt; {{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Paula D.|date=June 2015|title=Sybil Ludington, the Female Paul Revere: The Making of a Revolutionary War Heroine |url= http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/TNEQ_a_00452 |journal=[[The New England Quarterly]]|volume=88|issue=2|pages=187–222|doi=10.1162/TNEQ_a_00452|s2cid=57569643|issn=0028-4866}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether the ride occurred is questioned.&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite news |title= Did the Midnight Ride of Sibyl Ludington Ever Happen? |last= Tucker |first= Abigail |date= March 2022 |access-date= July 6, 2022 |url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/did-midnight-ride-sibyl-ludington-ever-happen-180979557/ |work= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/sybil-ludington-biography-3530671 |title= Sybil Ludington, Possible Female Paul Revere |publisher= [[ThoughtCo]] |date= August 15, 2019 |access-date= July 6, 2022 |last= Lewis |first= Jone Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eschner&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonianmag/was-there-really-teenage-female-paul-revere-180962993/ |work= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |title= Was There Really a Teenage, Female Paul Revere? |last= Eschner |first= Kat |date= April 26, 2017 |access-date= July 6, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family accounts of Ludington's ride say an exhausted messenger arrived at the Ludington house to inform them of the British advance on Danbury, and she rode throughout neighboring towns in what is largely today's [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] to round up the local militia. In Ludington's family account, she is said to have ridden more than {{convert|40|mi|km}} through a rainy night, alerting Patriots and avoiding Loyalists to raise the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1907), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook384/&gt; Ludington's men were too late to assist at Ridgefield, but they formed part of the force that harassed the British on their return to the beach.&lt;ref name=Cook384&gt;Cook (2006), p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ridgefield-CT memorial.jpg|thumb|A memorial plaque created by The Connecticut Society of the Order of Founders and Patriots of America]]

Beginning in 1877, residents of Ridgefield have remembered the battle with some form of anniversary ceremony every 25 years. Connecticut Governor [[Phineas C. Lounsbury]] hosted a full-day tribute at his [[Phineas Chapman Lounsbury House|Town Street mansion]] in conjunction with the town's bicentennial celebration in 1908. The 150th anniversary affair in 1927 featured the publication of George Lounsbury Rockwell's ''History of Ridgefield'', and the 200th anniversary was held a year early to tie in with America's [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebration in 1976. The bicentennial and 225th anniversary celebrations included re-enactments of the battle, for which portions of Town Street (now Main Street) were covered with dirt for sake of authenticity.&lt;ref name=ridgefield/&gt;

In 1854, a monument was erected in Ridgefield to honor David Wooster.&lt;ref name=Ives429/&gt;  The [[Keeler Tavern]] is now a local museum which features a British cannonball lodged in the side of the building.  Educational markers are maintained at various points of significance throughout the town, including the locations where David Wooster was mortally wounded and Benedict Arnold was pinned under his shot horse.  There is a stone marker near the site of the barricade where both Patriot and British troops were buried together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/results.asp?Town=Ridgefield&amp;State=Connecticut|title=HMDB markers in Ridgefield, CT|access-date=2010-05-05|publisher=hmdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Haven, a [[Wooster Square|public square]] was named for Wooster, as was [[Wooster Street (New Haven)|Wooster Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (1911), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

''Altri Libertini'' is the first book by the Italian writer, [[Pier Vittorio Tondelli]].

It was published in 1980 by Feltrinelli and features a collection of six stories which are loosely related to one another:  ''Postoristoro'', ''Mimi e istrioni'', ''Viaggio'', ''Senso contrario'', ''Altri libertini'', and ''Autobahn''. The stories present the lives and exploits of young men and women caught up in the 1980s, and Tondelli, through his writings, depicts their dreams, pains, emotional outbursts, ingenuity and, at times, their irreparable mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italialibri.net/opere/altrilibertini.html Altri Libertini – Pier Vittorio Tondelli – Recensione&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received considerable attention upon publication and was censored by the authorities for obscenities only twenty days after its appearance in bookstores in Italy as it was being prepared for its third edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;tondelli.comune.correggio.re.it&quot;&gt;[http://tondelli.comune.correggio.re.it/database/correggio/tondelli.nsf/b4604a8b566ce010c125684d00471e00/207bcd4694dada86c1256c000059de02!OpenDocument Centro di Documentazione Pier Vittorio Tondelli – Correggio – Pier Vittorio Tondelli – Altri libertini&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book is a series of short stories, the author preferred to describe the work as a ''romanzo a episodi'' (serial novel),&lt;ref name=&quot;tondelli.comune.correggio.re.it&quot;/&gt; in order to emphasise the thread that connected all of the stories to each other.

'''Puerto Rico Highway 53''' or '''PR-53''' (unsigned '''Interstate PR3''') is a main [[tollway]] that is parallel to [[Puerto Rico Highway 3]], which goes from [[Fajardo, Puerto Rico|Fajardo]] to [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DTOP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://act.dtop.pr.gov/index.php/download/traffic-data-report-2000-2009/?wpdmdl=528 |title=Datos de Transito 2000-2009 |last=Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works |author-link=Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works |language=es |access-date=April 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some segments are still in planning, but when finished it will be about {{convert|58|mi}} in length.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Two tunnels, about 0.6&amp;nbsp;mi (1&amp;nbsp;km) long each, in the towns of [[Yabucoa, Puerto Rico|Yabucoa]] and [[Maunabo, Puerto Rico|Maunabo]] were completed in {{start date|2008|10}}. It will connect the cities of Fajardo, [[Ceiba]], [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico|Naguabo]], [[Humacao, Puerto Rico|Humacao]], Yabucoa, Maunabo, [[Patillas, Puerto Rico|Patillas]], [[Arroyo, Puerto Rico|Arroyo]], [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]] and Salinas, thus bordering the entire eastern and southeastern coasts of Puerto Rico. Its northern terminus is at PR-3 and PR-194 in Fajardo, and its south terminus is at [[PR-52]] in Salinas.

==Route description==
The highway consists of five toll plazas; these are at Ceiba Norte, Humacao Norte, Humacao Sur&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Humacao Bridges|url=http://bridgereports.com/pr/humacao/ |website=National Bridge Inventory Data |publisher=US Dept. of Transportation|access-date=19 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (near [[Palmas del Mar]]), Guayama and Salinas. All toll plazas have [[AutoExpreso]] lanes.

Three phases of the tollway have been completed: the first one was from Salinas to Guayama, which is about {{convert|7.5|mi}} long (milepost 83 to 95&amp;nbsp;km), the second from Fajardo to Yabucoa at {{convert|28|mi|abbr=on}} (This includes an incomplete bridge in Yabucoa that does not fall into the high-speed highway classification in the interstate system as it is only one lane per direction and will require the addition of an additional bridge or constructing a bridge over the existing bridge, as it lies in a main corn and plantain field.) Recently {{convert|1.2|mi}}, between Yabucoa and Maunabo, includes the last tunnel, Vicente Morales, was opened in October 2008. The total constructed highway at this time is {{convert|34|mi}}, leaving nearly {{convert|25|mi}} to be constructed in Yabucoa (including the other additional tunnel) and from Maunabo to Guayama which is the longest to-be-built segment. The lanes in the Yabucoa segments were divided by painted yellow lines and no-passing zone boards, but a concrete median barrier had to be installed because some cars still passed others going slower, resulting in deadly head-on collisions; illegal night races also had deadly consequences.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

PR-53 is the tollway with the lowest traffic in Puerto Rico, and very few congestion jams have been reported. PR-53 does not enter highly populated towns (none of them are over 100,000; the largest are Fajardo, Humacao and Guayama) and is not close to increase its traffic due to the fact that most of the population in the east part of Puerto Rico live in the San Juan metro area, Caguas and Cayey, cities where PR-53 makes no appearance; and the main traffic in Humacao is mostly located on the [[PR-30]] and [[PR-60]] highways. The center/business area of Humacao is accessed via PR-30 and PR-60, not by PR-53. Because of this, PR-53 has no more than two lanes per direction in the constructed segments and will probably have no more than two lanes per direction in the entire length.

PR-53 is also prone to flooding in the areas near Naguabo and Fajardo: during heavy rains, it is sometimes closed to traffic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} There are current proposals to convert [[Puerto Rico Highway 3|PR-3]] from Rio Grande to Fajardo into a freeway to provide a controlled-access route between PR-53's northern terminus and the second phase of PR-66.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} At the rate of construction, the entire PR-53 corridor might be completed within the next ten years.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The first segment of PR-53 was opened in 1994; from Fajardo to Ceiba, in 1994, and from Ceiba to Humacao, in 1997, except between exit 13 and 17 in summer 2002.

The '''Pouce Coupe River ''' is a major tributary of the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Its name is officially spelled ''Pouce Coupé River'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pouce Coupé River|url=http://www4.rncan.gc.ca/search-place-names/unique.php?id=IABZN|work=Querying Canadian Geographical Names|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is commonly written without the acute accent.

Originating in Alberta's [[Saddle Hills County]], it flows into British Columbia's [[Peace River Regional District, British Columbia|Peace River Regional District]], then returns in Alberta in [[Clear Hills County]], where it empties into the Peace River.

The region of Pouce Coupe Prairie, from which the river and village of [[Pouce Coupe, British Columbia|Pouce Coupe]] take their names, was called that for a [[Dunneza|Beaver Indian]] Chief named 'Pouscapee'. The first European settler in the region was Hector Tremblay, who built a cabin there in 1898.  Tremblay, of [[French people|French]] origin, translated 'Pouskapee's Prairie' into the nearest French words of similar sound ({{lang|fr|pouce coupé}}, meaning &quot;cut thumb&quot; or &quot;cut-off thumb&quot;).

==Course==
The Pouce Coupe originates in a small lake in [[northern Alberta]], at an elevation of {{convert|860|m|ft}}, in the ''Pouce Coupe Prairie'' of the southern [[Peace River Country]], west of [[Spirit River, Alberta|Spirit River]] and [[Woking, Alberta|Woking]], between Saddle Hills and Blueberry Hill. It flows west and receives the waters of Boone Creek before reaching the British Columbia–Alberta border.

The river then turns northwest to the village of [[Pouce Coupe, British Columbia|Pouce Coupe]]. The Pouce Coupe Regional Park is established on the banks of the river east of the village and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway2]], at the confluence with Bissette Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbctourism.com/communities/Pouce_Coupe|title=Pouce Coupe|author=Northern BC Tourism|accessdate=2008-02-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20050111182052/http://www.nbctourism.com/communities/Pouce_Coupe|archivedate=2005-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It receives the waters of Dawson Creek east of the city of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]], then turns northeast, entering once again the province of Alberta, north of [[Alberta Highway 49|Highway 49]]. The course runs through a canyon that reaches depths of {{convert|220|m|ft}} in this section. [[Ammonite]] fossils harvested from the geological formations opened in the canyon can be found in the Dawson Creek Northern Alberta Railways Park museum. The river continues north and empties into the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]], south of [[Alberta Highway 64|Highway 64]], at an elevation of {{convert|380|m|ft}}.

The '''Irish Abroad Unit''' was established in 2004 following an announcement by [[Brian Cowen]] TD, then [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. The Irish Abroad Unit is a dedicated Unit within the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] and coordinates the provision of services to Irish [[emigrant]]s across the globe and administers financial support to organizations in the [[voluntary sector]] engaged in the delivery of services to Irish emigrants.  

[[File:Iveagh House morning.jpg|thumb|right|Iveagh House, Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland]]

Grants are extended to groups in the voluntary sector who provide advice and support to Irish people abroad, particularly those that help migrants access their rights and entitlements in their host countries. Priority is given to organizations that support the most vulnerable and marginalized, such as the older Irish community in [[Great Britain]] and undocumented Irish in the [[United States]]. Smaller grants have also been allocated to Irish groups in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[France]] and [[Mexico]] as well as to a number of organizations in Ireland who provide pre-departure information and also advice to those emigrants who may be considering returning to Ireland. In 2007, the Irish Abroad Unit awarded grants of €14.165 million to organizations in eleven different countries.

Following increases in funding, the program has expanded to include a number of capital projects, as well as culture and heritage projects that support community networks and build on the interest of citizens abroad in their Irish heritage. 

In general, recipients of Emigrant Services funding are Irish community organizations who have a functioning board of management, show clear objectives and have an accounting framework in place. The payment of grants to individual Irish citizens’ resident abroad is beyond the remit of the Irish Abroad Unit.

'''Captain Lewis Alonzo Yancey'''  (September 16, 1895 – March 2, 1940) was an American aviator and air navigator who toured America, Central America, and the Caribbean in a [[Harold Frederick Pitcairn|Pitcairn]] [[autogyro]].

==Biography==
Born in Chicago, Yancey enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in 1911 and was made a lieutenant during World War I. He left the Navy in 1921 and became a ship's officer for the [[Isthmian Steamship Company]]. With continued study, he achieved [[master mariner]] status and the title of Captain.

Yancey joined the [[United States Coast Guard]] in April 1925 and became interested in aviation and the science of navigation then. His knowledge of air navigation put him in demand with pilots in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1927 he made his first transcontinental flight as co-pilot.

==History-making flights==
In 1929 Yancey and [[Roger Q. Williams]] made their historic flight from [[Old Orchard Beach, Maine]] to Rome. En route, their  [[AviaBellanca Aircraft|Bellanca]] [[monoplane]] &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, hit fog and was forced to fly blind for most of their first day. However, due to Yancey's navigational calculations, once able to see their way, the team found themselves still exactly on course. Their one emergency stop, in  [[Santander, Spain]], occurred thirty-one hours and thirty minutes into the flight. Upon arriving in Rome, Yancey and Williams were met with crowds &quot;almost as fervent&quot; as those greeting Lindbergh in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Capt. Yancey Dies&quot; The New York Times, March 4, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Yancey, William H. Alexander, and Zeh Bouck made the first-ever flight from New York to Bermuda in a [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson]] monoplane equipped with pontoons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bermuda-online.org/aviation.htm  Bermuda's aviation history and pioneers]&lt;/ref&gt; Forced down, the plane spent the night at sea but was able to take off again under its own power the next morning; the first plane ever to do so. The crew made the flight in about eight and a half hours of flying time.

In 1938 Yancey flew with [[Richard Archbold]] to New Guinea for the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

==Death, tributes, and legacy==

Yancey died unexpectedly of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral hemorrhage]] at his home in [[Yonkers, New York]]. He was 44.

In his lifetime, Yancey received decorations from [[Albert I of Belgium]], [[Pope Pius XI]], [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] and [[Benito Mussolini]]. From the U.S. Navy, Yancey received a medal for his work on meteorology during World War I.

Yancey was the author of several books on aviation including ''Aerial Navigation and Meteorology'' (1929).  He frequently contributed stories about his flights to [[The New York Times]], once sending a story via radio from 3,500 feet in the air. Yancey advocated making radio communication a regular function of flying. He advised that a radio operator be part of a flight crew so the pilot would not have to divide his attention while flying.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yancey Find Radio Vital to Air Travel&quot;, The New York Times, September 23, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered a celebrity for his accomplishments, in New York City Yancey's likeness was captured in caricature for [[Sardi's]], the theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/the/thesardis.xml The New York Public Library Inventory of  Sardi's Caricatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yancey is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ancexplorer.army.mil/publicwmv/#/arlington-national/search/results/1/CgZ5YW5jZXkSBWxld2lz/ ANC Explorer]&lt;/ref&gt;
